Flask model with SSL, API Keys and JWT Framework
################################################

It was a development study to have Flask working SSL, supporting REST APIs with
API Users/Keys and doing calls using JWT Tokens to external APIs, providing
public keys signature. This is a good approach when you do not have a API
Gateway.

After my study finishes, I identified that it could be a model and I decided to
share it, them you can start your own API project and is not need create it
from scratch.

It also supports Docker.
